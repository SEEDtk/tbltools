=head1 SEEDtk Services Helper

This is the helper object for implementing common services in SEEDtk. It contains a constructor that
connects to the L<Shrub> database and methods to perform the basic script functions. All helper objects
must have the same interface.

The fields in this object are as follows.

=over 4

=item shrub

The L<Shrub> database object used to access the data.

=back

=cut

=head2 Special Methods

=head3 new

    my $helper = STKServices->new();

Construct a new SEEDtk services helper.

=cut

sub new {
    my ($class, $opt) = @_;
    my $retVal = {
    };
    bless $retVal, $class;
    return $retVal;
}

=head3 connect_db

    $helper->connect_db($opt);

Connect this object to the Shrub database.

=over 4

=item opt

L<Getopt::Long::Descriptive::Opt> object containing options from L<Shrub/script_options> for connecting to
the correct database.

=back

=cut

sub connect_db {
    my ($self, $opt) = @_;
    # Connect to the database.
    my $shrub = Shrub->new_for_script($opt);
    # Store it in this object.
    $self->{shrub} = $shrub;
}

=head3 script_options

    my @options = $helper->script_options();

Return a list of the command-line option specifiers for this object. These options are only used if we need
to connect to the database. They should be in the format expected by L<Getopt::Long::Descriptive::describe_options>.

=cut

sub script_options {
    return Shrub::script_options();
}

=head2 Service Methods

=head3 all_genomes

    my $genomeList = $helper->all_genomes();

Return the ID and name of every genome in the database.

=over 4

=item RETURN

Returns a reference to a list of 2-tuples, each 2-tuple consisting of (0) a genome name and (1) a genome ID.
All of the genomes in the database are returned.

=back

=cut

sub all_genomes {
    my ($self) = @_;
    my $shrub = $self->{shrub};
    my @genomes = $shrub->GetAll('Genome', '', [], 'name id');
    return \@genomes;
}

=head3 all_features

    my $featureHash = $helper->features_of(\@genomeIDs, $type);

Return a hash mapping each incoming genome ID to a list of its feature IDs.

=over 4

=item genomeIDs

A reference to a list of IDs for the genomes to be processed.

=item type (optional)

If specified, the type of feature ID desired. Only feature IDs with matching types will be returned.

=item RETURN

Returns a reference to a hash mapping each incoming genome ID to a list reference containing all the features in the
genome.

=back

=cut

sub all_features {
    my ($self, $genomeIDs, $type) = @_;
    my $shrub = $self->{shrub};
    my %retVal;
    # This string is added to the end of the parameter used in filtering the features. If a type is specified,
    # it filters on feature type as well as genome ID.
    my $parmSuffix = ($type ? "$type.%" : "%");
    for my $gid (@$genomeIDs) {
        # Get the IDs of the desired features. Note the feature ID contains both the genome ID and the feature
        # type. This is not the cleanest way to filter the query, just the fastest.
        my @fids = $shrub->GetFlat('Feature', 'Feature(id) LIKE ?', ["fig|$gid.$parmSuffix"], 'id');
        # Store the returned features with the genome ID.
        $retVal{$gid} = \@fids;
